Welcome to my GitHub profile! I don't have much stuff to share in here but whatever.

## Basic Info
- Living somewhere in Hanoi, Vietnam.
- Fabric modder at [Phá»ŸMC](https://github.com/phomc).
- I'm not sure about my role at [MangoPlex](https://github.com/MangoPlex) atm.
- Tends to reinvent the wheel.

## Skills
> These are not verified by external source so don't take my words for it.

- Java
  + Bukkit plugins development (I actually learned Java by making crappy Bukkit plugins lol).
  + A bit of Fabric mods development ("a bit" because I don't think I'm good at the [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) thing).
- JavaScript
  + TypeScript
  + ES6+
  + NodeJS
- Web
  + JavaScript
  + CSS and some SCSS
  + DOM manipulation
- Misc
  + Inkscape
  + Ability to use Stack Overflow.
  + A small amount of Linux knowledge (small enough to use Linux for web development and not Sysadmin thing).

## My projects that I think they are cool
- [Mixery](https://github.com/nahkd123/Mixery): Digital audio workspace that runs in your browser, so Chromebook users can brag about how their laptop is still useful. Don't have time to maintain it right now.
- [Serarif](https://github.com/nahkd123/Serarif): Sans serif font. Basically my attempt to make the font that appears in my dream. Not perfect but I think it's decent.

## Contact info
- Email address: If you know how to use Git, you should be able to obtain my email address (or maybe you can guess it).
