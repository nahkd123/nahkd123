### Overview

- [Web Development](#skills-web)
- [Other Skills](#skills-misc)

### Java <a id="skills-java"/>
- More than 5 years of writing code with Java and still counting (2023)
  + This might not reflect my true Java skill, but the earliest trace of me writing Java is 2017.
- Bukkit plugins development
  - Most of my plugins are distributed on [MCVN](https://minecraftvn.net).
- A bit of Fabric mods development
  - "A bit" because I don't think I'm good at the [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) thing.

### JavaScript <a id="skills-js"/>
- TypeScript
- ES6+
- NodeJS

### Web <a id="skills-web"/>
- [JavaScript](#skills-js)
- CSS/SCSS
- DOM manipulation (people tends to call it "vanilla JS")
- New to JSX/TSX
  + I'm not interested in React library btw.
  + I actually like the JSX syntax. It's like writing HTML, but more on writing JS and not tabbing between ``.js`` and ``.html``.
- A bit of PWA

### Misc <a id="skills-misc"/>
- Inkscape
- Ability to use Stack Overflow.
- A small amount of Linux knowledge (small enough to use Linux for web development and not Sysadmin thing).

## My projects that I think they are cool <a id="cool-projects"/>
- [Mixery](https://github.com/nahkd123/Mixery): Digital audio workspace that runs in your browser, so Chromebook users can brag about how their laptop is still useful. Don't have time to maintain it right now.
- [Serarif](https://github.com/nahkd123/Serarif): Sans serif font. Basically my attempt to make the font that appears in my dream. Not perfect but I think it's decent.
